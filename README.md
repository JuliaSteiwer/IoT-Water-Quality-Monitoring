# IoT-Water-Quality-Monitoring
Monitoring water quality parameters using an IoT-based system.

<h2>Resources</h2>
<h3>Tutorials</h3>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.aeq-web.com/heltec-lora32-v3-board-arduino-ide-lorawan-setup/">this tutorial</a> by Alex from AEQ-WEB for setting up LoRa with TTN and the Heltec Lora32 V3 board.</p>
<h3>Codes</h3>
<p>The code for putting the board into deep sleep is based on <a href="https://github.com/Heltec-Aaron-Lee/WiFi_Kit_series/issues/6#issuecomment-1574824770">this reply</a> by GitHub user Quency-D.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>Thanks to Friedrich Kerchnawe (@FritzOS) here on GitHub for providing me with a working deep sleep code (<a href="https://github.com/JuliaSteiwer/IoT-Water-Quality-Monitoring/issues/1#issue-2075032778">find the code here</a>).</p>
<p>Thanks to Steven Boonstoppel from the Heltec community for pointing out some obvious errors in my code that I had failed to notice (<a href="http://community.heltec.cn/t/wifi-lora-32-v3-send-sensor-data-via-lora-then-go-back-to-deep-sleep/14392/2?u=jsteiwer">link to his post</a>).</p>
<p>Thanks to user dstacer from the Heltec community for his detailed descriptions, suggestions, and help when I faced multiple issues with my setup and code (<a href="http://community.heltec.cn/t/connecting-multiple-sensors-to-heltec-lora-v3-board-and-sending-the-data-to-thingspeak/14329">link to the thread</a>).</p>
