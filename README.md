[!NOTE]
<p>My papers, posters etc. corresponding to this project will be uploaded in the Publications folder. As soon as one of these is published "officially", e.g. in a journal or ipen access site, I will also put the proper citation with the DOI here.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<h3>Tutorials</h3>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.aeq-web.com/heltec-lora32-v3-board-arduino-ide-lorawan-setup/">this tutorial</a> by Alex from AEQ-WEB for setting up LoRa with TTN and the Heltec Lora32 V3 board.</p>
<h3>Codes</h3>
<p>The code for putting the board into deep sleep is based on <a href="https://github.com/Heltec-Aaron-Lee/WiFi_Kit_series/issues/6#issuecomment-1574824770">this reply</a> by GitHub user Quency-D.</p>
